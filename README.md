Bustle-ish
=========================

A very simple mockup of the front end of a news website similar
to the popular site Bustle.

Installation
------------

Clone this project onto your local system. Open a terminal window
and change the directory by entering
`$ cd desktop/bustle-ish`. In order to run the app,
start up a local web server. In a Mac OSX environment, enter
`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`in the terminal
window and navigate to *localhost:8000* in a web browser. In a
Windows OS environment, download a program such as
[Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml), copy it to the project
folder, and double-click it to launch a server. Finally, open the page
in a browser.

Of note, this app uses the Ember.js client-side MVC framework
version 1.10.0 and jQuery library version 1.10.2.

Usage
-----

Upon display of the home html page, click on a desired news story
image/link for more detail. Of note, this app is currently not
serviced or populated with actual news content. Furthermore, no
actual links are attached to the carousel news stories. At this
time, the app serves as a potential news site front end utilizing
the Ember.js framework.
